# tradingview-angular-example

[Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/) Angular jsapi example base on a fake data and fake websocket :smile:.

## Requirement
This repository doesn't have a tradingview charting library for some unknown reasons.

Just create a issue and leave your email there for receiving the lib.

Someone(NOT ME AT ALL!) will send lib.zip to you as soon.

## How to run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
